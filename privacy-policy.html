   <h1>Privacy Policy for the FieldOps and Vikas Apps by ISPL</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong>22-10-2024</p>

    <p>At Ispl, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
        personal information when you use our app, "FieldOps & Vikas by ISPL."
    <p>
        This is an internal company application, which will only be used by employees during work hours. Any data
        collected is only used for monitoring updates on work projects. All data will be managed securely and privately
        on Google cloud servers and will be deleted once an employee leaves the organization.

    </p>
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect personal data such as your name, email address, location data, and any other information you provide
        directly to the app. We may also collect non-personal information, including device information and app usage
        statistics.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data to improve our services, provide support, and manage user accounts. Location data is
        used to provide field reports and track service-related activities.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data with third parties except for the service providers essential for our app's
        functionality (e.g., Firebase for data storage). Data is never sold to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, and destruction. Your
        data is stored securely using encryption technologies.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to provide our services or as required by law. You can
        request the deletion of your data at any time.</p>

    <h2>6. Crash Reporting & Device Info</h2>
    <p>We use Sentry for crash reporting to help us identify and fix issues in the app. The app collects device information 
        such as model, OS, app version, battery level, memory and storage details, IP address, timezone, and crash logs. 
      This data is used solely for crash reporting, debugging, and improving app performance. The information is shared only 
      with Sentry and is never sold, ensuring your data remains secure and used only to enhance your experience.</p>

    <h2>7. Real-Time Location Services</h2>
    <p>Our app may use foreground services to access your location while you’re using it. This is only to provide real-time
     data for field updates and is not shared with anyone outside the app’s services.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong>ispl.firebase@gmail.com</p>
